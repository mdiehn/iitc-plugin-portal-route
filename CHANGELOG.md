# Changelog

This project is in active development.

Current release: `1.3.1`

## 1.4.0 - Unreleased

### Added

- Added first-pass shape selection for loaded IITC portals, with circle/polygon drawing, preview counts, add-to-route, and replace-route actions.

## 1.3.1 - Unreleased

### Fixed

- Hide Portal Route controls injected into the IITC portal info panel when the Portal Route layer is turned off.

## 1.3.0 - Released 2026-05-08

### Added

- Added clearer manual-point placement feedback, including a small panel/info-panel hint while Add placement mode is armed.
- Added a stronger stale-route cue with a highlighted Replot button, stale compact stats, and a Menu Route/Replot fallback.
- Added Undo to the shared Menu.

### Changed

- Continued the button/menu helper refactor by normalizing Route/Replot, map export menu items, mini-control button options, and shared control class names through the helper layer.
- Started the button/menu helper refactor by extracting shared Portal Route helpers for smart buttons, mini-control buttons, and context menus without intended behavior changes.
- Add now toggles manual point placement when nothing is selected, so pressing Add again cancels placement mode.
- Escape now cancels manual point placement on desktop.
- Opening Menu, Maps, Route, Library, or Settings cancels manual point placement.
- Route row buttons use compact symbols on mobile while keeping full Up/Dn/Del labels on wider screens.
- The shared Menu now has a direct Route/Replot action, with the route list split out as Route List.

### Fixed

- Clear Portal Route's cached selected portal when IITC unselects a portal, so Add can enter manual point placement mode again.

## 1.2.0 - Released 2026-05-06

### Added

- Added a direct **Add** / **Del** control in the route list and portal info panel.
- Restored compact **Up**, **Dn**, and **Del** controls on each editable route row.
- Added small route stats to the portal info panel: total time, drive time, wait time, and distance.
- Added Undo for recent route edits, including adds, deletes, moves, imports, route loads, loop changes, and wait-time changes.
- Added one shared **Menu** smart button for Add me, Loop, Clear Route, Save, Google Maps, Apple Maps, Route, Library, and Settings.
- Added an active manual-point placement state for **Add**, including a crosshair cursor on desktop.

### Changed

- Loop mode now keeps start/end marker letters visible and only changes their styling to loop-blue.
- Replaced the separate panel Actions, Maps, and Menus smart buttons with the shared **Menu** button.
- Kept the mini control exception layout as **M**, **L**, **+/-**, **count**, **=**, with **M** for map exports and **=** for Menu.
- Make compact route stats in the info panel slightly more visible while keeping them small.
- Removed native browser/mobile tooltips from controls; controls now use accessible labels instead.
- Restored the mini-control **=** button to the normal black mini-control styling.

### Fixed

- Fixed mini-control **+** on an empty route so a selected portal is added before falling back to manual waypoint add mode.
- Fixed **Add** with nothing selected so it arms manual map-point placement instead of adding current location.

## 1.0.0 - Released - 2026-05-02

### Known limitations
